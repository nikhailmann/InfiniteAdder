# InfiniteAdder
Implementation of linked list data structure
This class reads in two files containing digits that make up integers and puts them in a doublylinked list, then cycles through each list and multiplies by their respective 10's place, then places them in a third linked list, where carrying (if necessary) is done and then is printed out to the console.
